# UCI-Math-10-Davis
Chris Davis's teaching materials for UC Irvine Math 10.  As of August 4, 2021, nothing is polished here, and it should probably just be ignored for now.
 
Topics for Math 10, Fall 2021:
* Basics of Python
* Tools for data manipulation, especially pandas and NumPy
* Tools for machine learning, especially scikit-learn and Keras
* Mathematical aspects of machine learning (loss functions, gradient descent)
* Plotting, especially Altair
* Ability to understand documentation for unfamiliar Python libraries
* Creating and sharing apps using Streamlit
